# Answers To Lab 4, Part 1

## Var Keyword
1. Line 9 prints 20. 
2. Line 13 also prints 20. 
3. The reason we shouldn't use var is because var's scope is accessible inside
the whole function, it's not limited to being inside if-statements

## Let Keyword 
1. Line 9 prints 20.
2. Line 13 prints an error because let does not exist outside of the if block

## Const Keyword
1. Technically, the code wouldn't reach line 9 because a const variable is trying to be reassigned. Results in a Type Error.
2. Similarly, Line 13 wouldn't be reached because of a Type Error.
